CineRex

This project will allow a user to create an account on our website service called CineRex. The user can search different movies 
and like and dislike them. After liking three movies, the recommendation engine will show other different types of movies based on
the preferences chosen. The user can always see their likes and dislikes chosen through the preferences page.

All Inter processing is done through RabbitMQ using the Advanced Messaging Queuing Protocol (AMQP) 

As of right now this is what we have done through the first half of the semester and will continue to update this as we
get/complete the next set of deliverables.
